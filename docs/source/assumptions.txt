Assumptions:
1. created Tables are not listed more than once

2. once created tables are listed their columns are not listed anywhere else other than immediately after creation

3. the SQL files I'm parsing don't exist in the directory we originally created. I can't get Sphinx virtual machine
to understand the directory structure we have and pull from that.
