=============================

Over the next decade, the LINZ Topographic Office is working towards its vision of recognising the way location information can help unlock new patterns and knowledge, particularly when it is combined with other types of information. One of our strategic goals is to improve national scale datasets and maximize their opportunities for reuse by a variety of national and regional stakeholders.
