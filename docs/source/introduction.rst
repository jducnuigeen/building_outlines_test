Introduction
=============================

Purpose
-----------------------------

This document provides detailed metadata (data dictionary) for the simple and comprehensive NZ Building Outlines data published on the LINZ Data Service.

Background
----------------------------

Over the next decade, the LINZ Topographic Office is working towards its vision of recognising the way location information can help unlock new patterns and knowledge, particularly when it is combined with other types of information. One of our strategic goals is to improve national scale datasets and maximize their opportunities for reuse by a variety of national and regional stakeholders.

Building outlines have been identified as a dataset of national importance, and influence a multitude of decisions made across New Zealand at both the national and regional levels. It is therefore critical to have a consistent and dynamic dataset available. This building outline dataset will provide a foundation for various stakeholders to map risk modelling, environmental assessment, urban development, resilience planning in addition to the visualization and physical location of buildings.
